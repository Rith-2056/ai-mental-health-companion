# AI Mental Health Companion – Project Overview & Milestones

## Project Overview

The AI Mental Health Companion is an empathetic chatbot designed to support mental well-being through journaling, mood tracking, and personalized habit suggestions. Using an advanced LLM (Gemini API), it engages users in natural, supportive conversations, analyzes emotional patterns from journaling entries, and provides tailored feedback to enhance self-awareness and emotional resilience.

### Core Features
- **Empathetic Chatbot:** Engages in supportive conversations with users.
- **Journaling Interface:** Allows users to record daily thoughts and feelings securely.
- **Mood Analysis:** Detects emotional patterns from past interactions.
- **Habit Suggestions:** Provides personalized recommendations to improve mental well-being.
- **Data Privacy:** Uses Firestore backend with secure session logging and user-level data separation.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Built for local and cloud deployment, supporting up to 10 concurrent users during testing.
